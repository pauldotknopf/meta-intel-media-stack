Subject: [PATCH 049/153] drm/i915: Allow scheduler to manage inter-ring object synchronisation

The scheduler has always tracked batch buffer dependencies based on
DRM object usage. This means that it will not submit a batch on one
ring that has outstanding dependencies still executing on other rings.
This is exactly the same synchronisation performed by
i915_gem_object_sync() using hardware semaphores where available and
CPU stalls where not (e.g. in execlist mode and/or on Gen8 hardware).

Unfortunately, when a batch buffer is submitted to the driver the
_object_sync() call happens first. Thus in case where hardware
semaphores are disabled, the driver has already stalled until the
dependency has been resolved.

This patch adds an optimisation to _object_sync() to ignore the
synchronisation in the case where it will subsequently be handled by
the scheduler. This removes the driver stall and (in the single
application case) provides near hardware semaphore performance even
when hardware semaphores are disabled. In a busy system where there is
other work that can be executed on the stalling ring, it provides
better than hardware semaphore performance as it removes the stall
from both the driver and from the hardware. There is also a theory
that this method should improve power usage as hardware semaphores are
apparently not very power efficient - the stalled ring does not go
into as low a power a state as when it is genuinely idle.

The optimisation is to check whether both ends of the synchronisation
are batch buffer requests. If they are, then the scheduler will have
the inter-dependency tracked and managed. If one or other end is not a
batch buffer request (e.g. a page flip) then the code falls back to
the CPU stall or hardware semaphore as appropriate.

To check whether the existing usage is a batch buffer, the code simply
calls the 'are you tracking this request' function of the scheduler on
the object's last_read_req member. To check whether the new usage is a
batch buffer, a flag is passed in from the caller.
