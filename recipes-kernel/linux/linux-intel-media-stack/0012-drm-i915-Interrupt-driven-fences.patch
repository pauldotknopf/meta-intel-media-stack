Subject: [PATCH 012/153] drm/i915: Interrupt driven fences

The intended usage model for struct fence is that the signalled status
should be set on demand rather than polled. That is, there should not
be a need for a 'signaled' function to be called everytime the status
is queried. Instead, 'something' should be done to enable a signal
callback from the hardware which will update the state directly. In
the case of requests, this is the seqno update interrupt. The idea is
that this callback will only be enabled on demand when something
actually tries to wait on the fence.

This change removes the polling test and replaces it with the callback
scheme. Each fence is added to a 'please poke me' list at the start of
i915_add_request(). The interrupt handler then scans through the 'poke
me' list when a new seqno pops out and signals any matching
fence/request. The fence is then removed from the list so the entire
request stack does not need to be scanned every time. Note that the
fence is added to the list before the commands to generate the seqno
interrupt are added to the ring. Thus the sequence is guaranteed to be
race free if the interrupt is already enabled.

Note that the interrupt is only enabled on demand (i.e. when
__wait_request() is called). Thus there is still a potential race when
enabling the interrupt as the request may already have completed.
However, this is simply solved by calling the interrupt processing
code immediately after enabling the interrupt and thereby checking for
already completed requests.

Lastly, the ring clean up code has the possibility to cancel
outstanding requests (e.g. because TDR has reset the ring). These
requests will never get signalled and so must be removed from the
signal list manually. This is done by setting a 'cancelled' flag and
then calling the regular notify/retire code path rather than
attempting to duplicate the list manipulatation and clean up code in
multiple places. This also avoid any race condition where the
cancellation request might occur after/during the completion interrupt
actually arriving.

v2: Updated to take advantage of the request unreference no longer
requiring the mutex lock.

v3: Move the signal list processing around to prevent unsubmitted
requests being added to the list. This was occurring on Android
because the native sync implementation calls the
fence->enable_signalling API immediately on fence creation.

Updated after review comments by Tvrtko Ursulin. Renamed list nodes to
'link' instead of 'list'. Added support for returning an error code on
a cancelled fence. Update list processing to be more efficient/safer
with respect to spinlocks.

v5: Made i915_gem_request_submit a static as it is only ever called
from one place.

Fixed up the low latency wait optimisation. The time delay between the
seqno value being to memory and the drive's ISR running can be
significant, at least for the wait request micro-benchmark. This can
be greatly improved by explicitly checking for seqno updates in the
pre-wait busy poll loop. Also added some documentation comments to the
busy poll code.

Fixed up support for the faking of lost interrupts
(test_irq_rings/missed_irq_rings). That is, there is an IGT test that
tells the driver to loose interrupts deliberately and then check that
everything still works as expected (albeit much slower).

Updates from review comments: use non IRQ-save spinlocking, early exit
on WARN and improved comments (Tvrtko Ursulin).

v6: Updated to newer nigthly and resolved conflicts around the
wait_request busy spin optimisation. Also fixed a race condition
between this early exit path and the regular completion path.
