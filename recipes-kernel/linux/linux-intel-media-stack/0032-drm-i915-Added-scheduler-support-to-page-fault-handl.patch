Subject: [PATCH 032/153] drm/i915: Added scheduler support to page fault handler

GPU page faults can now require scheduler operation in order to
complete. For example, in order to free up sufficient memory to handle
the fault the handler must wait for a batch buffer to complete that
has not even been sent to the hardware yet. Thus EAGAIN no longer
means a GPU hang, it can occur under normal operation.
