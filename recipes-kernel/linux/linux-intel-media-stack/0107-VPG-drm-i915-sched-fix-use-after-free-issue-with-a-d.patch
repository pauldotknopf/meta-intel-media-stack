Subject: [PATCH 107/153] [VPG]: drm/i915/sched: fix use-after-free issue with a dangling pointer.

When the queue is still full it can go back around the loop and look for a new request.
At the point of acquiring the spinlock, it could get stalled by other scheduler
processing on a different thread during which the queue becomes drained.
The for loop will fail to find a request but not update the value of req.
Thus the code will try to ref/wait/unref the old request a second time.
Except of course, it has already been freed by this point and is a dangling pointer.
Hence Bad Things happens.
