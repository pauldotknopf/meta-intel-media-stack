Subject: [PATCH 014/153] drm/i915: Cache last IRQ seqno to reduce IRQ overhead

The notify function can be called many times without the seqno
changing. A large number of duplicates are to prevent races due to the
requirement of not enabling interrupts until requested. However, when
interrupts are enabled the IRQ handle can be called multiple times
without the ring's seqno value changing. This patch reduces the
overhead of these extra calls by caching the last processed seqno
value and early exiting if it has not changed.

v3: New patch for series.

v5: Added comment about last_irq_seqno usage due to code review
feedback (Tvrtko Ursulin).

v6: Minor update to resolve a race condition with the wait_request
optimisation.

For: VIZ-5190
