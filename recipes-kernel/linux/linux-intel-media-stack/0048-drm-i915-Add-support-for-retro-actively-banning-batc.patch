Subject: [PATCH 048/153] drm/i915: Add support for retro-actively banning batch buffers

If a given context submits too many hanging batch buffers then it will
be banned and no further batch buffers will be accepted for it.
However, it is possible that a large number of buffers may already
have been accepted and are sat in the scheduler waiting to be
executed. This patch adds a late ban check to ensure that these will
also be discarded.

v4: New patch in series.
